### How to change your actual password <a name="changepass"></a>

You can change your password at any time by using the UNIX command `passwd` directly on front end. The change is taken into account immediately. 

```sh
$ passwd
Changement de mot de passe pour l'utilisateur $USER.
(current) LDAP Password: 
Nouveau mot de passe : 
Retapez le nouveau mot de passe : 
```

### Forgotten password <a name="forgotpass"></a>

In this case, you must reset your password on the simlab website (in progress) to request the re-generation of the randomly generated password which is then sent to you by e-mail.
